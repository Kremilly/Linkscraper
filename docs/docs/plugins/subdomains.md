## Subdomains

With the subdomains plugin, you can list all subdomains of the given URL. To use this command, simply type it into your terminal:

```shell
python linkscraper -u https://example.com -a get-plugins -p subdomains
```

The plugin utilizes the api from [threatcrowd](https://ci-www.threatcrowd.org/). Its free version doesn't require any API key.
